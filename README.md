# loglogx
Very Simple logging(in the meaning of ham radio) TUI script for Linux.  

I prefer paper logs, but when I calling CQ, due to the large number of QSOs, I end up using this script.  
So, Not recommended for everyday use by people who mainly use computer logs.  

## Installtion
```bash
Install dialog
$git clone https://github.com/mizoc/loglogx
```

## Usage
```bash
$./loglogx.sh FILE_SAVE_DESTINATION.csv
$./csv2adif.sh IN.csv OUT.adi  #When you want to change format to adif
```
